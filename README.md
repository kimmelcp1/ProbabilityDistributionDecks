# ProbabilityDistributionDecks

Hi, feel free to download the three decks associated with Probability Distributions and distribute as you suggest.  I used these as part of a simulation class that I instructed in the Summer of 2019.  The decks demonstrate how to produce proability disributions in R.  Feel free to disseminate or use at your own whim (even for other classes).     

The first deck provides a very brief overview of Probability Distributions and how to create any PDF curve in R.
The second deck provides an overview of the various properties of Probability Distributuions and how to calculate the PDF, CDF and inverse CDF for any distribution in R along with random number generation.
The third deck shows how to perform Maximum Liklihood Estimation (MLE) best fitting in R along with Goodness of Fit Tests.
